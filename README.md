# WordGuessingGame-using-Elixir
The Word Guessing Game is a beginner-friendly project aimed at learning the basics of the Elixir programming language. Players guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. Correct guesses reveal the letter in the word, while incorrect guesses are tracked. The game continues until the word is revealed or a set number of wrong guesses is reached.
